<main> <p> <h3>The World of Kreator.res is something to behold.</h3> Reality is bent, perceptions twisted into one; but represent many, and a firm physical grasp on basically anything isn't feasible.
But fear not; there is no danger here. Let that wild runaway wheel in your mind roam freely down the never ending desert road, breath the air at the edge of the atmosphere, and take note of the subtle taste you're left with. </p>

<p> Enjoy this harsh Dimension we live in and it's Parellel.The one where love exist's built off Routine; even towards the harsh. Love is UNDEFEATABLE! Don't forget it.. ever. That's all you have sometimes. </p> </main>
