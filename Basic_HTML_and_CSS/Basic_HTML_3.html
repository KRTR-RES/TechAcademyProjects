<h3>CIRCLES</h3>

<div>
<h3>Keep it comin'</h3>

	<p>Circles have no start or finish: no beginning or ending. Where does the pain start and when does it end? Does it ever?</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Happiness</h3>
	<p> Oh the Happiness i feel when i help someone. The kind gesture will always make its way back to me.. Often like a circle's curve. Right BACK to me.</p>
